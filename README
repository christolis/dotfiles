christolis's dotfiles
=====================

Here we are finally, a central repository with all dotfiles that I use every
day. These files are the result of the themes and tools that you see when I
stream my work to other people on the internet.

Feel free to clone this repository, use the dotfiles, change them how you like
them. The way I've designed my dotfiles work for me, though that does not
necessarily mean they will work for you. Experiment freely...

I got motivated to upload my own version of dotfiles and share them with other
people since I have been badgered with a countless stream of questions ranging
from what keyboard I use to what tools and themes I use. Well, hopefully this
repostiory solves all your questions.

When cloning this repository on your local machine, make sure you've passed the
`--bare` parameter and make an alias that is bound to where you've cloned the
repository as well as the work tree directory:

    alias dotfiles='git --git-dir=$HOME/.dotfiles/ --work-tree=$HOME'

Unless you happen to be a masochist and you find great entertainment in
rewriting these parameters every time you would like to perform a command
regarding dotfiles.
